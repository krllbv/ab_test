In this project, I conducted an analysis of a new recommendation algorithm and its impact on the CTR metric. All data was extracted from Clickhouse, then I cheked the accuracy of the system using A/A test. Next, I analyzed the experiment results using several methods: t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and non-parametric bootstrap. I also used the smoothed CTR(Laplace's approach) method and bucket conversion(which use "Avito" in their A/B tests) to explore the data deeper. Based on this, I provided my recommendations for the new algorithm.
